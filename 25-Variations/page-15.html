  A Boat 
  
  
  
  O beautiful 
  was the werewolf 
  in his evil forest. 
  We took him 
  to the carnival 
  and he started 
  crying 
  when he saw 
  the Ferris wheel. 
  Electric 
  green and red tears 
  flowed down 
  his furry cheeks. 
  He looked 
  like a boat 
  out on the dark 
  water.

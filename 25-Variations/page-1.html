  A Boat <br>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  O beautiful <br>
  was the werewolf <br>
  in his evil forest. <br>
  We took him <br>
  to the carnival <br>
  and he started <br>
  crying <br>
  when he saw <br>
  the Ferris wheel. <br>
  Electric <br>
  green and red tears <br>
  flowed down <br>
  his furry cheeks. <br>
  He looked <br>
  like a boat <br>
  out on the dark <br>
  water. <br>

  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<strong>O beautiful
  was the werewolf
  in his evil forest. </strong><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<em><strong>We took him</strong>
  to the carnival
  and he started 
  crying
  when he <strong>saw
  the Ferris wheel.</strong> <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<strong>Electric</strong>
  green and red tears
  flowed down
  his furry <strong>cheeks.</strong></em> <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<strong>He looked
  like a boat
  out on the dark
  water.</strong> <br>

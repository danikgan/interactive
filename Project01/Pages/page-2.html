  A Boat <br>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  O beautiful
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
  was the werewolf <br>

  in his evil 
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
  forest. We took him <br>

  to the 
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
  carnival
  and he started <br>

  crying 
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
  when he saw 
  the Ferris <br>

  wheel.

  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
  Electric
  green and red <br> 

  tears
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
  flowed down
  his furry <br>

  cheeks.

  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
  He looked
  like a boat <br>
  out on the 
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
  dark
  water. <br>

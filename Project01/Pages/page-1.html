		to the<br> 

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

		crying when he saw the <br>

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		Ferris

		and red <br>

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		tears flowed down
		his furry <br>

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

		cheeks. He looked 
		like <br>

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		a boat out on the dark water. <br>
